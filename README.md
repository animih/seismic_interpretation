# seismic_interpretation

**Goal** : developing 2D model for both detecting of fault cluster and predicting scalar parameters of it on sinthetic seismic dataset

# Text materials
- [Literature review](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hbrhnpykvgqq) (in progress)

# Next steps

## Research
- [ ] Develop better metrics for prediction
- [ ] Implmenet continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and train model in spectral domain
- [ ] Implement single-target model for scalar prediction
- Further research in multi-task learining

## Code
- [ ] Rearrange model and traing function to custom models
- [ ] Provide examples of model's prediction
